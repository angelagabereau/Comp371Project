Uses SOIL. http://lonesock.net/soil.html Get yourself a copy and include in path.

Texture paths in this submission version of code are local to my machine.  I will correct this when I demo the project.  It requires chaning the path in each class loadTexture().

Does not include the camera control from PA2.  I have refactored the code base and I did not have enough time to reintegrate the camera controls.  My apologies.  It is next on the todo list.
